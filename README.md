#### Hello :wave:

My name is Diego Martínez, I´m a _Frontend Developer_ and _Graphic Designer._

Two years ago I started studying programming and when I saw that I could combine my knowledge and experience in graphic design within the programming world I decided to focus 100% of my time on learning code, good practices and develop web pages/applications that would provide solutions to problems that users might have.

**I work mainly in React and Tailwind CSS :computer:**
