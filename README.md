#### Hello :wave:

My name is Diego MartÃ­nez, IÂ´m a _Web Developer_ and _Data Analyst._

Two years ago I started studying How to become a developer and when I saw that I could combine my knowledge and experience in graphic design within the developer world I decided to focus 100% of my time on learning how to code, good practices and develop web pages/applications that would provide solutions to problems that users or clients might have.

**Studying Java Backend thanks to a GlobantÂ´s scholarship ðŸ”¥**
